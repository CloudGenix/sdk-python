# CloudGenix Python SDK v5.4.1b2
Python2 and Python3 SDK for the CloudGenix AppFabric

#### Synopsis
Intended to be a small, lightweight SDK wrapper around the CloudGenix API for easy use. 
Initial version requires knowledge of JSON/Dict objects for POST/PUT/PATCH operations.

#### Requirements
* Active CloudGenix Account
* Python >= 2.7 or >=3.6
* Python modules:
    * Requests + Security Extras >= 2.22.0 - <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>
    * Websockets (if Python >= 3.6) >= 8.1 - <https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>

#### Code Example
Comes with `example.py` that shows usage to get a JSON list of sites.

Super-simplified example code (rewrite of example.py in ~4 lines of code):
```python
# Import the CloudGenix SDK API constructor and JSON response pretty printer
from cloudgenix import API, jd

# Instantiate the CloudGenix API constructor
sdk = API()

# Call CloudGenix API login using the Interactive helpers (Handle SAML2.0 login and MSP functions too!).
sdk.interactive.login()

# Print a dump of the list of sites for your selected account
jd(sdk.get.sites())
```
